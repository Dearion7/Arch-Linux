# Arch-Linux

This repository contains small scripts that can be used to extend the functionalities of Arch Linux. The goal of these scripts are to be as small and efficient as possible, as Arch Linux was intended to be.

## Applications

### battery_notify

This application can be used to give information about the battery status. It gives a notification when the battery level gets too low, as well as when the battery is fully charged.

### Contribution
